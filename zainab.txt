changes in api_endpoint: 
added semantic vocie search api_endpoint

work done:
weâ€™re caching 50 emails first. then the user can ask something like:
"what was the mail faiza sent me" the audio is transcribed,
turned into a search query using the LLM, and passed to semantic search,
which goes through the cached emails and returns the most relevant ones. 

execution:
1. go to localhost/docs
2. transcribe audio
3. build cache
4. execute the semantic search
